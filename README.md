As a emergency services administrator, I want to notify people that may be affected by a CBNRE emergency quickly, using existing infrastructure, so that they may stay informed and safe.

Acceptance Criteria:
When I push an emergency alert from our system, it will be received by the local public safety organization and processed appropriately.

This is an appropriate goal because it is important that the proper public safety organizations and the public are quickly and accurately informed during any disaster.

It is testable by submitting a test of the emergency alert system according to the format and requirements of the local system.

This story requires several others upstream, namely one to organize the information and package it for public distribution.  It also assumes that proper channels have already been established with the public safety authorities that we will use.
