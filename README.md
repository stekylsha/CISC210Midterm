## This is the develop branch version of the file.
Create a branch _from this branch_ named from your [JIRA](https://104.198.107.245:8443) issue.  In this file, change the contents to be your story and acceptance criteria.  Explain how the story is apropos and how your acceptance criteria are testable, or any other supporting documentation.  When finished, create a pull request against the [CISC210Midterm](https://github.com/stekylsha/CISC210Midterm) develop branch.

As a user, I want my sensor to beep constantly at 100 decibels when it detects lethal amounts of carbon monoxide, so that I know there is a carbon monoxide leak.
Acceptance Criteria: When the sensor detects 800 PPM or more in less than two hours, it shall beep at 100 decibels constantly.

Our story is appropriate because Carbon Monoxide is a chemical gas and leaks are common.
Our acceptance criteria is testable because we can put the sensor in a room and release gas until we measure it to be 800 PPM in less than two hours and we can measure the decibels of the sensors beep.
