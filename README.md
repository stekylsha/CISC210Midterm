The story relates to the epic because it is dealing with a device that detects a various agent (radiation) and does something interesting with it (scans the levels of radiation). It is applied to real world situations where radiation has been exposed to an environment (i.e. Hiroshima). This would allow farmers and civilians to grow crops that are healthy to eat.
