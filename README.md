# CISC210Midterm
## This is the develop branch version of the file.
Create a branch _from this branch_ named from your [JIRA](https://104.198.107.245:8443) issue.  In this file, change the contents to be your story and acceptance criteria.  Explain how the story is apropos and how your acceptance criteria are testable, or any other supporting documentation.  When finished, create a pull request against the [CISC210Midterm](https://github.com/stekylsha/CISC210Midterm) develop branch.

As a provider of radiological particle sensors, I want to display the biological risk of exposure of radiation in the form of the SI unit sievert (Sv), so that the reading from the sensor is easily interpreted.

AC: When I take a reading of 1 joule of energy per 1 kilogram of matter, the sensor should display a reading of 1 Sv, per the equation 1Sv = J/kg.

CISC210MT-68 is apropos to the CBNRE Detection Sensor Epic because it articulates how the radiation risk sensor displays its reading. The calculation for, and additional information regarding sievert (Sv) can be found here:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sievert

The Acceptance Criteria (AC) is testable, for the sensor's displayed reading can be compared to the controlled testing environment, showing that the sensor's value displays the correct value.
