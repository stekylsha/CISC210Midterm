If sensor detects Dihydrogren Monoxide over a level of 70% in the air, the sensor will alarm, and play a message "Dangerous chemical dihydrogen monoxide was detected in the air. Please evacuate the building, and inform the closest supervisor."

Acceptance criteria: If dihydrogen monoxide in the air over 70% is detected, the alarm will sound, and play the message.

The story is appropriate for your epic because you said you wanted something interesting to happen when the sensor detected something. It'd be funny to see your supervisor's reaction to seeing you panic about water being in the air. The acceptance criteria is testable by the sensor detecting a higher humidity level(70%) in the air. When the air reaches a certain humidity level, the alarm will go off.
